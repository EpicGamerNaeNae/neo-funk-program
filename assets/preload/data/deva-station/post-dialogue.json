Shuichi: Man, these songs just get harder and harder.

Kokichi: That’s the point of the game, Shumai. You best be prepared, as these next few challenges will be just as difficult.

Shuichi: At least we’re halfway through this madness..

Gundham: I...I've never lost before!

Gundham: This is impossible! How did you beat me?!

Shuichi: By singing better than you?..

Gundham: You may have bested me in battle THIS time, Shuichi...but you won't be so lucky the next time we meet!

Shuichi: W-wait...I have to fight you AGAIN?!

Kokichi: No, that's just what he's programmed to say once you've beat his ass successfully.

Shuichi: Oh...okay.

Kokichi: Now come, Shumai. I must transport us to your next challenge.

Shuichi: Finally! I'm almost out of here...
