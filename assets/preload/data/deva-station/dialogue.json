Shuichi: Not gonna lie…although your appearance is questionable, you might be my favorite challenger yet.

Gundham: Wait, what’s wrong with my appearance? 

Kokichi: You look like something Monotaro made for his art class...

Gundham: You will regret mocking my appearance with such nonsense!

Shuichi: Do you ever shut the hell up, Kokichi?!

Kokichi: No, I wasn’t programmed with that function.

Shuichi: You’re gonna get me killed in this world.

Kokichi: I missed the part where that’s my problem.

Gundham: Time to end your winning streak! 

Gundham: I will emerge victorious, and you will be no more than a memory!
