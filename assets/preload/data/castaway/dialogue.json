Shuichi: Whoa…that was intense. This virtual world is more impressive than I thought.

Shuichi: I would enjoy this place a whole lot more if I wasn’t trapped here against my will..

Kokichi: *pops into existence*

Kokichi: Welcome to Strawberry House. Here, you will face your third challenger.

Shuichi: Alrighty then…who’s next on the list?

Gundham: That would be me, Mr. Saihara.

Shuichi: FINALLY! Someone got my damn name right!

Kokichi: There he is…Gundham Tanaka, the Ultimate Breeder.

Shuichi: The Ultimate WHAT?!

Kokichi: He’s an animal breeder, calm down.

Shuichi: Look, let’s just get this over with. I have other matters to attend to, once I leave this place.

Gundham: My, aren’t we impatient? Very well…I accept your challenge!
