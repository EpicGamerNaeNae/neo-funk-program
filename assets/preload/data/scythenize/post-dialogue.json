Maki: It vexes me greatly that you’re still alive..

Kokichi: Haha! We win! Looks like you can’t kill us, Maki Roll!

Maki: My god, you’re super annoying.

Kokichi: I know, I practice every day!

Maki: I can see that.

Shuichi: Okay! Where’s the next challenge? I wanna get the hell out of here already.

Maki: You may use the globe right behind you. If you touch it, you will be teleported to the next challenge in the Strawberry House.

Shuichi: The…Strawberry House? Sounds stupid, if you ask me.

Kokichi: With that comment,  you’ve officially triggered half of the people playing this mod.

Shuichi: What are you talking about, Kokichi?

Kokichi: Nevermind…please just touch the damn globe so we can leave.

Shuichi: *he walked over to the globe and pressed his hand against it*

Shuichi: WHOA!-*he vanished*
